<h2>Michael Garfield's blog</h2>
<p>Michael regularly updates his blog with incredible content. His artwork, blog posts, and lectures are an inspiration.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the site, the eye is drawn to the header. Then, the bright blue text of the most recent post invites the reader to scroll down and start reading.</p>
<p>Visually, the site is dark, glowing, inviting, exciting, and has high contrast.</p>
<p>The website organizes the thoughts and work of its creator into an organized format that is easy to naviate. It contains blog posts containing recent musings, links to related concepts, ideas, artwork and events, Michael's music, his paintings, his talks, as well as work for sale.</p>
<p>The site is imaginative, visionary, exploratory, inventive, and inspirational.</p>
<p>It is easy to find what you are looking for beginning from the home page, but because some of the navigation tabs link to a separate Bandcamp website, from there the user has to use the back button at times.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to browse through the site's content, as it is generally organized both by category and chronologically.</p>
<p>After being on the site for a while, I often find myself feeling inspired, as well as excited to check out other content external to the website that was linked to in a recent post.</p>
<p>Michael sells his art on the site. I haven't bought anything yet, but I have considered doing so because I feel that I have gotten a lot of value out of the site's content.</p>

<h2>Ars Technica</h2>
<p>Ars Technica is a tech news website that covers a wide variety of topics and manages to consistently put out articles that are both informative and generally enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>The site is bright in color, but this is actually largely due to a large number of brightly colored images. The site's background and text are mostly in grayscale, but there are some flashes of red, green, and orange to add some livelihood.</p>
<p>The site is laid out in three columns, with the feature story shown two columns wide at the top of the page, drawing the reader in. </p>
<p>The site's designers also have clearly put some thought into the typefaces on the site, which work together quite well.</p>
<p>The site is easy to navigate due to a navigation bar that is present no matter where you are on the site, allowing you to go back to the home page or main menu.</p>
<p>The site even offers the reader the ability to change from a three column to a two column layout.</p>
<p>The site is news oriented, so it is practical and informative, but it also strives to be fresh, fun, and entertaining.</p>
<p>The site sells subscriptions which offer access to premium content, but there is so much free content available on the site that I've never looked into this.</p>

<h2>The Economist</h2>
<p>A third site that I visit relatively frequently is <a href="http://www.economist.com">www.economist.com</a>, the website for the popular magazine <em>The Economist</em>. </p>
<p>The site's articles discuss global news and politics, finance, economics, and science and technology.</p>
<p>Arriving at the site, one can't help but notice the bright red color of the magazine's logo.</p>
<p>At the top of the site iss a navigation bar organized by topic, and below that are headlines and images linking to various articles. This is not so different from the Ars Technica site in this respect. The articles are separated into three columns, but another section above spans across all three columns, and focuses on just four articles, offering a large image that is seen when the mouse rolls over the respective headline. This type of interactive design really adds to the user experience.</p>
<p>The fonts and color schemes used are clean and formal, which is appropriate for a news-oriented website.</p>
<p>The site is made even easier to navigate due to a search function that is available at the top of each page.</p>
<p>The site sells subscriptions to the magazine, which also grants unlimited access to articles. I have been a subscriber in the past but am not currently.</p>
