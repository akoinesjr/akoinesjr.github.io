	<p>As web content has evolved, it has become more feature rich. We have gone from simple, static websites, to a myriad of dynamic web applications. Many functions that in the past would have required desktop applications now take place in the browser. If you want an example, look no further than Gmail. Much of this has been done with JavaScript.</p> 

	<p>What it has done is give websites the power to interact with and accept input from users. While every language has its critics, there is no denying the impact that JavaScript has had on the web.</p>

	<p>In addition to its massive impact on the way we interact with web content, new tools have been and continue to be built using JavaScript to expand its capabilities. The Node.js platform has increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side applications. New libraries such as jQuery have streamlined the way we use JavaScript to interact with objects in the DOM.</p>
