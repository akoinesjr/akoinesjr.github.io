	<p>In the first three weeks of Phase 0 I've had the chance to participate in five pair programming sessions in total -- two with a guide and three without. I've enjoyed working in pairs because I've found that being able to get and give feedback from another person working on the same problem can be much more engaging and stimulating than trying to struggle through alone. Problems are easier to solve when viewed from multiple angles, and having another set of eyes can help to avoid an "engineering tunnel vision".</p>

	<p>When working in pairs or groups, clear and open communication is critical. When I have an idea for a next step on a project while working in pairs, I do my best to articulate what I am considering doing to my partner clearly before proceeding, to make sure that we both understand what our plan is, as well as to get feedback on my idea and possibly refine our approach. Of course, this can be challenging at times, particularly when you are working with complex concepts.</p>

	<p>The feedback I received was helpful and generally positive, but I found reading it to be slightly anxiety inducing. I want working together to be a positive experience for my peers, and it can be difficult to hear that it is anything but. I know that sometimes when I am nervous or having trouble articulating something, I will sometimes speak too quickly, unclearly, or for too long. I also need to make sure that I listen to my peers' ideas without interruption. I want my peers to know that I value their input!</p>

	<p>Writing feedback can be difficult as well. Giving positive, glowing feedback is easy, but when I felt that part of an experience was less than perfect it is not always easy to come up with a way to articulate that in a way that will be helpful to the recipient. Despite these difficulties, I think that this system with its focus on specific, actionable feedback is a good one that will give me the chance to improve my ability to work together effectively in pairs and groups.</p>
