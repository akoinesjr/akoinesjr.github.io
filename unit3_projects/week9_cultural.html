		<p>When pair programming, it's critical to have effective lines of communication open between both parties. Good feedback from your peers can give you insight into what is it like to work with you as a partner, and how to improve that experience for both of you.</p>
		<p>The most useful feedback is feedback that is able to articulate what specific actions were most or least effective (and how to improve on them). Feed should be "actionable, kind, and specific".</p>
		<p>Useful feedback need not always be negative - for example, you may find while pair programming that your partner consistently made an effort to make sure that you followed along with his explanations. Letting him know that you found this to helpful will let him know that it will be helpful for you (and his future peers) if he continues this behavior going forward.</p>
