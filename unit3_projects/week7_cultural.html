	<h1>Revisiting Stereotype Threat</h1>
	<h2>Building Community Through Values</h2>
</header>
<body>
<section>

	<p>In my first cultural blog, I wrote about the importance of community in the human experience, and stressed the importance of strong social ties and the ability to trust another</p>
	<p>Stereotype threat will persist for as long as stereotypes do. When people stereotype one another, they do so in part because they are unsure whether they can trust each other, and they are looking for a quick, reliable way to make this determination. Of course, this doesn't work.</p>
	<p>Some of the other values that I mentioned were integrity, loyalty, and truth. If we want to build a community where people can trust one another and where we do not fall victim to negative, divisive behavior, we should strive to be true to these values.</p>
