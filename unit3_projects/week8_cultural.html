		<p>As part of this week's curriculum, I watched a video from a discussion with Dev Bootcamp's founder Shereef Bishay. I found his discussion of Dev Bootcamp, its culture and its origins to be quite insightful. He explained how as the first program of its kind, one that is still only a few years old, Dev Bootcamp was born as an experiment, and continues to be today.</p>
		<p>Like any organization, the success of Dev Bootcamp is dependent on the efforts of everyone involved in the program. After hearing Shereef discuss the culture at Dev Bootcamp, I'm even more excited to attend as some of the points he made really resonated with me. Specifically, he mentioned the importance of taking charge of your own education. This advice really applies to life more broadly. To be successful, the ability to respond to a situation with aplomb and to react to obstacles intelligently is critical.</p>
		<p>As I approach the first day physically at Dev Bootcamp, I continue to become more excited by this opportunity to work with other motivated people to make the most of this opportunity to collaboratively learn new skills.</p>
