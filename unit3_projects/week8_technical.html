	<p>Ruby on Rails is a web application framework that is based on the Ruby programming language. Ruby was originally developed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. Ruby on Rails (or alternatively, simply "Rails") was originally released in 2005. It is now used extensively across the web on hundreds of thousands of websites.</p>
	<p>Ruby has grown in popularity because its design lends itself to building web applications very efficiently. It has other advantages as well, such as a built-in testing framework.</p>
	<p>Users can install Rails as a Ruby gem. The ability to do this is available in current versions of Ruby.</p>
