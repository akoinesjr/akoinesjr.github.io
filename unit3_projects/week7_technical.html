	<p>The SQL language gives us incredible capacity for managing data, but using it without consideration to security can be disastrous. One of the more common attacks that continues to cause damage today is the SQL injection attack.</p>
	<p>In a SQL injection attack, the intruder manages to, as the name suggests, maliciously inject code into an entry field for execution.</p>
	<p>Luckily, these attacks can be prevented with relatively simple methods. One effective method is to simply escape all user supplied input.</p>
	<p>Additionally, developers can used parameterized, rather than dynamic database queries. This means that the SQL code must be defined and then passed in to the query later, which makes a clear distinction between code and data.</p>
