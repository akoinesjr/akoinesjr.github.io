	<h1>Classes in Ruby</h1>

	<p>In Ruby, each class is itself an instance of the class Class. Each instance of a particular class has its own defining characteristics. This means that each instance has some defining attributes, and has the ability to be interacted upon using class methods.</p>

	<p>In the example below, we create a new class called FruitBasket, which takes the arguments fruit and quantity. Notice that these variables are preceded by the @ symbol. This signifies that they are instance variables. This means that each instance of the FruitBasket class will have its own, independent values for @fruit and @quantity which cannot be accessed outside of that instance.</p>

	<p>Next, we define a method called display, which allows us to display these values for each particular instance of FruitBasket.</p>
