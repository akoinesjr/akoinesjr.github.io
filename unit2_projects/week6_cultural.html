	<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
	<h2></h2>
</header>
<body>


	<section>
	<p>We live in a complex world, and our brains try to make sense of it by placing things into categories. Of course, when we do this with people, and assume that we know everything about who they are or how they will act based on their "type", this can have negative consequences.</p>
	<p>Often, this occurs when people stereotype others based on their skin color, gender, or other characteristic.</p>
	<p>This behavior can harm others through what is known as "stereotype threat". When a person knows that they are expected to act a certain way, or that they are believed by others to be somehow inferior, this can place a psychological weight on that person that can affect the way they perform on a certain task, or even change the way they choose to spend their time.</p>
	<p>Personally, I don't feel that I have felt this effect in any significant way in my own life, but I understand the damaging impact it can have.</p>
