	<p>The growth and the development of the internet and the ability to rapidly share and access information across the globe has profoundly changed the way we live our lives. We have come a long way from the days of dial-up modems to a world of smartphones, billions of users online, and increasingly ubiquitous instant access via mobile connections.</p>

	<p>One particular aspect of the internet has allowed for the incredible innovation that we have seen in recent years. This is the fact that no matter who is connecting to who, all data is treated equally. Your internet service provider has one role: to provide you with a fat, dumb pipe with which to connect to others on the network, regardless of who it is or where they are located. In this way, the internet is a utility, giving you the ability to connect to whoever you desire and share information.</p>

	<p>This means that whether I am connecting to my neighbor, a new start-up service, or Google, the traffic is treated equally and my ISP does its best regardless of who I am requesting to connect with to provide me with the fastest speed that they can.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/setting-record-straight-fcc-s-open-internet-rules">a recent proposal from the FCC</a> is set to change the game entirely. The FCC states that the proposal will not allow “unreasonable discrimination among users”, but who is going to determine what is considered reasonable? How can any discrimination at all be considered “reasonable”?</p>

	<p>If ISPs are allowed to discriminate between traffic, this means that they can charge large corporations for priority access. For example, Comcast might charge Netflix and YouTube a fee, which would then be passed on to the consumer, creating a situation similar to what we have seen for years with cable television.</p>

	<p>Web entrepreneurs such as Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian (who is <a href="https://www.crowdtilt.com/campaigns/save-net-neutrality-billboard-in-fccs-backyard">working to raise money to fight for this issue</a> understand that without true net neutrality, they would never have been able to get where they are today. Users are going to tend towards using the services that are the fastest and least expensive, and if a new start-up has to pay exorbitant fees to ISPs or be stuck with low service speeds, their chances of competing with incumbent megacorporations is going to be significantly reduced.</p>

	<p>Other activists like those at <a href="NoSlowLane.com">NoSlowLane.com</a> are working to prevent this from happening, but it remains to be seen how the FCC will rule on this critical issue.</p>
