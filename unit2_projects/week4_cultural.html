	<p>1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? </p>
	<p>I lived in a house with five roommates while in college, and this experience in volved quite a bit of conflict. All of my other experiences with roommates have been quite positive, but living with this group had some significant difficulties.</p>	

	<p>2. What was the source of the conflict?</p>
	<p>At the beginning of the year, we all got along quite well, and we had a large group of mutual friends who lived outside the house who would come to visit somewhat regularly. Our house had two floors. I lived downstairs with two of my friends, and three of our other friends lived upstairs. The upstairs roommates had a bit of a falling out with some of our other friends who lived outside the house, and this created quite a bit of tension as they no longer wanted them around, but we didn't feel that was fair. </p>
	
	<p>3. How did you handle that conflict? </p>
	<p>Not particularly well. We stopped communicating as well, and organized sharing of housework completely collapsed, which resulted in a much messier house, and by extension, frustrated housemates both upstairs and downstairs.</p>	
	
	<p>4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</p>
	<p>I'm not sure that I did a lot to make things worse, but I certainly could have done things to make it better. Looking at the "Compass of Shame", I believe most of us fell into avoidance, some of us into withdrawal, and some even into attacking others.</p>		
	
	<p>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</p>
	<p>I would have make an effort to engage the group in rational discussions to find a solution.</p>
	
	<p>6. What did you learn from this experience?</p>
	<p>Communication is key. If you are not willing to work with someone to solve a problem, you are never going to fix it.</p>
