	<h1>Functional vs. Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
</header>
<body>

	<section>
	<p>In programming, there are multiple paradigms that are the result of various approaches to decomposing and solving problems. Two of these are functional and object-oriented programming.</p>
	<p>The fundamental difference between these two paradigms is in their names, but it can take some time to fully understand them. Functional programming solves problem by using functions that perform various operations, while the object-oriented approach uses objects of various classes to give behavior to the data they contain.</p>
	<p>One thing that this means is that the data in object-oriented programming is mutable based upon the attributes of its class. This stands in opposition to functional programming, where data can only be changed by a function.</p>
